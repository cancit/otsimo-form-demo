## otsimo-form-demo

This is a demo website for showing otsimo-form in action.

[otsimo-form](https://github.com/cancit/otsimo-form) is a library and tool for generating forms from proto files. Current version of otsimo-form has a custom json architecture for forms and it will be json-schema compatible in next releases.

Currently this repository has examples for partial json schema support which is a work in progress. otsimo-form is inspired by this repository: https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form
